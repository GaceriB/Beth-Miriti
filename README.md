My name is Beth Miriti, an Executive Assistant and an aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for transforming information into meaningful insights. In my role as an Executive Assistant, I thrive on organization, problem-solving, and supporting leadership in making informed decisions. These strengths fuel my journey into data science, where I aim to combine my analytical mindset with technical skills to uncover trends, solve problems, and drive business growth.
My passion lies in using data to tell stories that matter â€” stories that empower organizations and people to make smarter, evidence-based choices. By bridging my experience in administration with data science, I bring a unique perspective: the ability to connect human needs with data-driven solutions.
